## HOW TO USE THIS FILE

This file is the single source of truth for this project.
At the start of every new session, share this file + the project zip with Claude and say:
**"Read the BUILDLOG.md and continue from [SESSION NAME]."**
Update this file at the end of every session with what was done and what's next.

## PROJECT VISION

A production-grade, privacy-first personal journaling app.
Built for one person now. Architected for thousands later.

**The core promise:**
> "Your journal is yours. We cannot read it even if we wanted to."

**Why this matters as a portfolio piece:**
- Demonstrates BA/PA thinking: requirements → decisions → architecture → roadmap
- Shows AI-assisted development done properly (human makes decisions, AI writes code)
- Real product used daily by the builder — not a toy project
- Privacy-first architecture is a genuine differentiator from Day One, Notion, Reflectly

---

## PRODUCT DECISIONS (locked in, do not revisit without reason)

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 target | Web app in browser | Validate visuals before committing to desktop |
| Phase 2 target | Electron desktop app | True install experience, real file storage |
| Data storage (Phase 1) | localStorage + export/import | Simple, works offline, no server needed |
| Data storage (Phase 2) | electron-store → encrypted local file | Permanent, survives browser clears, portable |
| Analytics engine | Local JavaScript only | No external service, fully offline, no installs |
| Telemetry | Zero, none, never | Privacy-first is non-negotiable |
| Cross-platform builds | GitHub Actions CI | Auto-builds Linux/Windows/Mac on every push |
| Linux format | AppImage | Download and double-click, no install needed |
| Windows format | .exe installer | Standard experience |
| Mac format | .dmg | Standard experience |
| Portfolio strategy | Demo video + case study write-up | Shows thinking, not just code |
| Future sync | End-to-end encrypted, optional | User owns encryption key, even dev can't read |
| Business model (future) | Free local app + optional paid sync | Obsidian model |

### Navigation views in App.tsx (14 views total)
1. **write** — Main journal entry (PenLine icon)
2. **entries** — Browse all entries (BookOpen)
3. **archive** — Archive view (Archive)
4. **calendar** — Calendar with entry dots (Calendar)
5. **mood** — Mood chart over time (TrendingUp)
6. **insights** — Pattern insights (Lightbulb)
7. **language** — Language/writing analysis (MessageSquare)
8. **eras** — Life chapters (Layers)
9. **threads** — Memory threads (FileText)
10. **questions** — Persistent questions (HelpCircle)
11. **anchors** — Reflection anchors/values (Heart)
12. **habits** — Habit builder with 21-day (Target)
13. **privacy** — Export/import/settings (Shield)
14. **legacy** — Data legacy/inheritance (FileText)

### Current storage mechanism
All data in `localStorage` via these keys:
- `journal_entries` — all journal entries
- `journal_habits` — habit definitions
- `journal_gentle_starts` — 21-day gentle starts
- `journal_habit_engagements` — habit check-ins
- Various other keys for eras, threads, questions, preferences

### Key data types (from types.ts)
```typescript
JournalEntry {
  id, date, whatHappened, feelings, whatMatters,
  insight, freeWrite, mood, energy, tags,
  reflectionType, eraId, visibility, isLongForm,
  questionId, createdAt, updatedAt
}

Habit { id, name, why, isArchived, createdAt, updatedAt }
GentleStart { id, habitId, startDate, endDate, engagements, completed, createdAt }
HabitEngagement { id, habitId, date, note, createdAt }
```

### HabitBuilder design philosophy (important — do not change)
- "Container for exploration, not a tracker for compliance"
- No streaks, no performance metrics, no urgency language
- Missed days are neutral, returning is success
- Reflection always counts as engagement
- 21-day gentle start already exists in logic — needs visual upgrade

---

## PLANNED ADDITIONS / CHANGES

### 1. 21-Day Habit Starter Visualisation (NEW)
**What:** Visual progress display for the first 21 days of a habit
**Design spec:**
- 21-cell grid (3 rows × 7 cols, like a compact calendar)
- Each cell = one day. Filled = engaged. Empty = not yet / missed
- Day counter: "Day 8 of 21"
- Milestone markers at day 7, 14, 21
- At day 21: celebration state — "Habit explored. What did you learn?"
- Tone: warm and curious, never punishing
- If a day is missed: cell stays neutral (no red, no X)
- Already has backend logic in habits.ts (startGentleStart, getActiveGentleStart)
- Need to add the visual component to HabitBuilder.tsx

### 2. Storage Abstraction Layer (NEW)
**What:** Wrap all localStorage calls in a storage interface so Phase 2 (Electron) only requires changing one file
**Pattern:**
```typescript
// storage/index.ts — single import everywhere
export const db = {
  getEntries() { ... }
  saveEntries() { ... }
  // etc
}
// In Phase 2, swap implementation to electron-store, interface stays identical
```

### 3. Export/Import Hardening
**What:** Make sure all data (entries + habits + eras + threads + preferences) exports and imports as one complete JSON file
**Current state:** PrivacySettings.tsx has partial export — needs to be comprehensive

## BUILD PHASES & SESSIONS

### PHASE A — Web App (Browser)
*Goal: See it running, make it yours, get it exactly right before locking design*

---

#### SESSION A1 — Get It Running
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (2026-02-27)

**What was done:**
1. Unzipped project into `~/premium-journal`
2. `npm install` — 280 packages, clean install
3. `npm run dev` — app running at http://localhost:5173
4. All 14 views confirmed working, no errors
5. Write → Save → Entry confirmed saving to localStorage
6. GitHub private repo created: `git@github.com:Krishna-Yelnure/premium-journal.git`
7. SSH key configured (ed25519 with passphrase)
8. `.gitignore` added (node_modules, dist, .env)
9. node_modules removed from repo, clean push done

**Issues fixed:**
- node_modules accidentally in first push — fixed with `git rm -r --cached node_modules`

**Session checklist:**
- [x] All 14 views render
- [x] Write saves entry, appears in Entries view
- [x] GitHub repo connected and clean
- [x] .gitignore in place
- [x] BUILDLOG updated and pushed

---

#### SESSION A2 — Storage Abstraction + 21-Day Habit Visual ← START HERE NEXT
**Status:** NOT STARTED

**Goal:** Robust data layer + the new habit visualisation

**Steps:**
1. Create `src/app/storage/index.ts` — abstracted storage layer
2. Replace all direct localStorage calls with the new storage module
3. Build 21-day grid component for HabitBuilder
4. Test export/import of complete data snapshot
5. Verify data survives page refresh

**Deliverable:** Data persists properly + 21-day habit grid visible

---

#### SESSION A3 — Visual Review & Iterations
**Status:** NOT STARTED

**Goal:** User (you) reviews every screen and requests changes

**Steps:**
1. Walk through every view with fresh eyes
2. List anything to change: layout, copy, missing features, confusing UX
3. Implement changes
4. Repeat until satisfied

**Deliverable:** App locked and approved. No more visual changes after this.

---

### PHASE B — Desktop App (Electron)
*Goal: Same app, real installed application*

---

#### SESSION B1 — Electron Wrapper
**Status:** NOT STARTED

**Prerequisites:** Phase A complete and approved

**Steps:**
1. `npm install --save-dev electron electron-builder`
2. `npm install electron-store`
3. Create `electron/main.js` — main process
4. Create `electron/preload.js` — secure bridge
5. Swap storage layer to use electron-store (file on disk)
6. Update `package.json` with electron-builder config
7. Test: `npm run electron:dev`

**Data file location after install:**
- Linux: `~/.config/premium-journal/journal.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%/premium-journal/journal.json`
- Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/premium-journal/journal.json`

**Deliverable:** App opens in Electron window, data saves to file

---

#### SESSION B2 — GitHub Actions CI
**Status:** NOT STARTED

**Steps:**
1. Create `.github/workflows/build.yml`
2. Configure matrix build: ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest
3. Push to GitHub private repo
4. Verify releases page produces:
   - `premium-journal-x.x.x.AppImage` (Linux)
   - `premium-journal-x.x.x-setup.exe` (Windows)
   - `premium-journal-x.x.x.dmg` (Mac)

**Deliverable:** GitHub Releases page with downloadable installers

---

#### SESSION B3 — Polish & Final Testing
**Status:** NOT STARTED

**Steps:**
1. App icon (512×512 PNG → auto-converted for each platform)
2. Window behaviour (min size, remember position/size)
3. Graceful close (confirm if unsaved)
4. Test full install → use → uninstall cycle on Linux
5. Final BUILDLOG update

**Deliverable:** Production-ready desktop app

---

### PHASE C — Portfolio
*Goal: Showcase to employers*

---

#### SESSION C1 — Portfolio Assets
**Status:** NOT STARTED

**Deliverables:**
1. **Demo video** (2–3 min Loom)
   - App launch from desktop
   - Write an entry
   - Show mood chart, insights, habits, 21-day tracker
   - Show privacy/export feature
   - Show it's offline (turn off wifi, still works)

2. **Case study document** (Google Doc or Notion)
   - Problem: existing journaling apps have telemetry / no true privacy
   - Decisions: why Electron, why local-first, why abstracted storage
   - Architecture diagram
   - Privacy principles
   - Roadmap to public release
   - Role: BA/PA — defined requirements, made architecture decisions, validated with AI tooling

3. **Professional README**
   - What it is
   - Screenshots
   - Privacy principles
   - How to install
   - Roadmap

---

## PRIVACY PRINCIPLES (non-negotiable, document these publicly)

1. **Local by default** — data never leaves your device without your explicit action
2. **No telemetry** — zero analytics, crash reporting, or usage tracking ever
3. **You own your data** — export everything as JSON anytime, in one click
4. **Open storage format** — journal.json is human-readable, not proprietary
5. **No account required** — the app works without signup, email, or identity
6. **Future sync = E2E encrypted** — when cloud sync is added, the server stores ciphertext only

---

## HOW TO START SESSION A2

In a new Claude conversation, say exactly this:

> "I am building a privacy-first journaling desktop app. Please read the BUILDLOG.md carefully, then help me complete Session A2."

Then attach:
1. This `BUILDLOG.md`
2. These specific files from `~/premium-journal/src/app/utils/`:
   - `storage.ts`
   - `habits.ts`
   - `eras.ts`
   - `threads.ts`
   - `questions.ts`
   - `preferences.ts`
3. `src/app/components/HabitBuilder.tsx`
4. `src/app/types.ts`

**No need to upload the full zip** — Claude only needs the files being changed in A2.
